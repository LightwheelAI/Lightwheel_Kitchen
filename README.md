## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

This project requires **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** and a compatible system. Recommended configuration:

- x86_64
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 
- NVIDIA RTX 30XX / 40XX series GPU (minimum 16GB VRAM)
- 64GB RAM or more

To get started with Isaac Sim, follow the official setup guide:  
üëâ [Isaac Sim: Getting Started](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/index.html)

## üîß Notes

- All USD assets are structured for compatibility with Isaac Sim‚Äôs physics and rendering pipeline.
- Assets can be reused in other environments by referencing their USDs.
- If any textures appear missing, ensure the `texture/` folder remains in the same directory hierarchy.
